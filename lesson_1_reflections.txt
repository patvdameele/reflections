How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    it showed all the changes and the bug was likely cause by a change

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    one could more easily go back to previous versions and find back
    similar ideas in previous versions, do more gradual refinement etc.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You do commits only after logical atomical changes

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    if the files are related a change will require changes in multiple files

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows the history if the repository
    git diff shows differences between commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    one can always revert to a previous version where the same problem did not occur
